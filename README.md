# Plato’s Pizza Sales For The Year 2015

**Introduction:**  

  For this case study, I am hired by Plato’s Pizza from New Jersey to help the restaurant use their data that have been collected from the past year, 2015, to improve operations. Here is the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales/data)  

**Business Tasks:**  

  Here are the questions that the owner asked:  
1.	What days and times do we tend to be busiest?  
2.	How many pizzas as we making during the peak periods?  
3.	What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?  
4.	What’s our average order value?

Here are the questions that I believe would help me gain more insight into the data given:  

1.	What are the best-selling pizza sizes?  
2.	What are the best and worst revenues per pizza?  
3.	Is there a clear pattern of the number of orders per month?
 
**Analyze:**  

  To answer these questions, the data was manipulated using SQL and Tableau. The SQL queries are posted in this file as well as the [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/PizzaSalesDashboard_17615453355810/PizzaSalesOvertheYear2015?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). All the questions above are answered in the dashboard except the average order value, which was found through SQL and will be posted below.

-	What’s our average order value?
    - The average order value is $16.73

**Conclusion and suggestions:**

- Taking advantage of Thursday’s, Friday’s, and Saturday’s afternoons for all pizzas, including the popular Classic Deluxe Pizza, by creating promotions, deals, and sales could help boost sales and customer activity as these are the popular times  
- Creating deals and promotions for large pizzas and medium pizzas, especially for the classic Deluxe, could help appeal to the customers  
- Since The Thai Chicken Pizza has the top revenue, promotions, deals, and sales could be used to help boost revenue  
- As The Brie Carre Pizza sells the least with only 490 orders for the year and only brought in $11,588 in the whole year, this pizza could be dropped as you advertise the top five pizzas  
- Since the average order value is $16.73, this would be a great basis to keep your deals around to make sure that you appeal to the customers
